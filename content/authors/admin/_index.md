I am a doctoral student in [Management in Information System](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/MIS/) at Krannert School of Management, Purdue University. I am fortunately advised by Professor [Karthik Kannan](https://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/kkarthik/) and [Jinyang Zheng](https://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/zheng221/).

My research is about the dynamics of human behaviors in the machine-platform-crowd transformation. I use machine learning, econometrics, and structural modeling methods to study the transformational impacts of information technology on human behaviors.  

Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my undergraduate study at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China in 2016.
